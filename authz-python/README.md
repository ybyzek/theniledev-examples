# Authorization

## Overview

As described in the [top-level README](../README.md), the mock scenario in these examples is a company that provides SaaS.

![image](../images/saas.png)

These examples let you choose what kind of SaaS offering is provided, one of:

- [Database as a Service](../usecases/DB/) (same as in the Nile Quickstart)
- [SkyNet as a Service](../usecases/SkyNet/)
- [Banking as a Service](../usecases/Banking/)
- [YOLO](../usecases/README.md#yolo)

For this service, you can use Nile's built-in entities to enforce access policies.
This example uses the Nile Python SDK to demonstrate authorization features in Nile in the following workflow:

- List policies
- Create a new policy that allows the user `read` permissions to instances of the type `DB` which have a property `environment=dev`. There is an implicit deny for all other instances.

  ```json
  {
      actions: ["read"],
      resource: {
        type: "DB",
        properties: {environment: "dev"},
      },
      subject: { email : "shaun@demo.io" },
  }
  ```

- List the `DB` instances allowed to be read by the user in a given organization: should be just those where environment is dev, none in prod
- Delete the policy


## Install Dependencies

Verify you are running Python version 3.7 or newer (check with `python --version`)

Run the following command:

```
python3 -m venv venv && venv/bin/python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Setup

You must do all the steps in the [Setup section](../README.md#setup) of the top-level README.md.

:stop_sign: **STOP** :stop_sign: Do not proceed until you have done the above setup :heavy_exclamation_mark:

Then, run the following command to preconfigure the Nile control plane with an entity, organizations, users, and entity instances for the mock usecase, so that you're not starting from scratch.

```
yarn --cwd ../quickstart/ install && yarn --cwd ../quickstart/ start
```

## Execute

To execute the workflow, run the following command:

```
venv/bin/python authz.py
```

## Overview

As described in the [top-level README](../README.md), the mock scenario in these examples is a company that provides SaaS.

![image](../images/saas.png)

The mock scenario in these examples is a company that provides a [Database as a Service](../usecases/DB/)
This quickstart programmatically setups up your [Nile](https://thenile.dev/) control plane similar to what is done in the Nile quickstart documentation.
By the end of this quick start, you will have:

- a workspace (your control plane)
- an entity definition with a schema (the definition of your data plane that represents a MySQL database)
- an organization (a tenant) with one user (end customer) in that organization
- an entity instance (logical instance of the MySQL database) in that organization

## Install Dependencies

Run the following command:

```
python3 -m venv venv && venv/bin/python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Your output should resemble:

```bash
Collecting anyio==3.6.2
  Using cached anyio-3.6.2-py3-none-any.whl (80 kB)
Collecting attrs==22.1.0
  Using cached attrs-22.1.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl (58 kB)
...

```

## Setup

You must do all the steps in the [Setup section](../README.md#setup) of the top-level README.md.

## Run

There are three ways to execute the quickstart:

1. Step-by-step from the Nile Admin Dashboard: follow the quickstart instructions on the Nile docs webpage for the UI quickstart, useful for people who like to use UIs
2. Step-by-step from the command line: execute snippets of Python code using the Python SDK (see [step-by-step](#step-by-step-from-the-command-line) instructions), useful to learn from individual code blocks
3. Programmatically from the command line: all steps executed with a single command (see [one-command](#one-command) instructions), quickest of the three options

### Step-by-step from the command line

1. Create an entity (refer to code [src/entity.py](src/entity.py)).

```
venv/bin/python src/entity.py
```

2. Create a user (refer to code [src/user.py](src/user.py)).

```
venv/bin/python src/user.py
```

3. Create an organization (refer to code [src/org.py](src/org.py)).

```
venv/bin/python src/org.py
```

4. Create an entity instance (refer to code [src/entity_instance.py](src/entity_instance.py)).

```
venv/bin/python src/entity_instance.py
```

### One-command

To execute the entire workflow, run the following command:

```
venv/bin/python src/all.py
```

## Validate

Login to the [Nile Admin Dashboard](https://nad.thenile.dev/) via SSO to see the control plane and entity instances (If your developer account is not SSO, enter the `NILE_DEVELOPER_EMAIL` and `NILE_DEVELOPER_PASSWORD` values you specified in the `.env` file).

Your dashboard should resemble below:

Nile automatically generates the OpenAPI spec for the new entity, see the `OPENAPI` tab in the dashboard.
